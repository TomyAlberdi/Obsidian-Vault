A network is a set of independent devices capable of electronically communicating with each other, sharing resources, and exchanging all kinds of information. 
## Classifications
Networks are classified in multiple ways.
### According to their geographical extension:
- **LAN (Local Area Network):** A network of devices connected within a range of less than 5 km. These are small networks that cover a short geographical extension, common in homes, offices, and small organizations.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** Has a range of up to 60 km because it consists of the interconnection of several LAN networks in a specific geographical area.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Considered wide-area networks, they cover a large geographical area, requiring access through public routes and using, at least partially, circuits provided by a telecommunications service provider. The size of this network can range between 100 and 1000 km.
### According to the connection method:
- **Guided methods:** Link devices through physical cable systems, such as twisted pairs, coaxial cables, or fiber optics. The advantage is that they lose less signal and have less noise. The disadvantage is the inconvenience of installing them in each area.
- **Unguided methods:** Connection is established through dispersed and area-reaching systems, such as radio waves, infrared signals, or microwaves - for example, satellite systems and Wi-Fi. They are a bit slower but much more convenient and practical.
### According to their degree of authentication:
- **Private network:** Can only be used by people who have the personal access key with which it is configured.
- **Public network:** Can be used by anyone as it does not require a key to access.
### According to their degree of diffusion:
- **Intranet:** Private network of computers that uses Internet technology to share part of its information systems and operational systems within an organization.
- **Extranet:** Private network used to securely share part of an organization's information with suppliers, buyers, partners, customers, or any other business or organization.
- **Internet:** Decentralized set of interconnected communication networks that use the TCP/IP protocol family, ensuring that the heterogeneous physical networks that compose it function as a single logical network of global reach.
## Characteristics:
- **Speed:** It is the time in which data is transmitted. The upload and download speed depends on the medium and the standards we use to communicate. It is generally measured in megabits per second.
- **Security:** Its goal is to prevent intruders from accessing the transmitted information.
- **Reliability:** Measures the relationship of failures in transmission: fewer failures, more reliable.
- **Scalability:** Prevents the service from declining if the number of users increases.
- **Availability:** It is the network's ability to always be operational.
## Speed:
- **Download speed:** It is the Internet's capacity to navigate the network, i.e., the speed at which we can download elements, for example, web pages.
- **Upload speed:** It is the capacity to upload data to the web, for example, the time it takes to upload a video to YouTube.
- **Packets:** These are the blocks into which information is divided when traveling through the network. The ping is the exact time it takes for a data packet to be sent from one device to another, measured in milliseconds.
### Speed Tests:
A speed test is a tool used to evaluate the performance of our data or Internet network. In it, we can see our upload speed, download speed, and ping.
## Basic Components:
#### Hub:
The Hub is a simple device with a single mission: to interconnect the computers of a local network. Its operation is straightforward; when a device on the local network connected to it sends data, the Hub replicates and instantly transmits it to the other computers on this local network.
#### Switch:
Switches are the smarter siblings of Hubs and are also used for creating local networks. The main difference is that through the Switch, the information sent by the originating computer goes directly to the destination computer without being replicated to the other devices connected.
#### Modem:
A modem is a device that sits between the router and the line from our operator. When we establish the connection with the operator, at the network level, the modem obtains a public IP address, which is logically unique. There can only be one public IP address on the Internet, which will identify our connection.
#### Router:
The router is the device that we all have in our homes to connect to the network. Basically, its function is to connect to the modem and the different devices we have. In this way, it can receive information and expand it to other devices either by cable or via Wi-Fi. A router assigns a local IP address to each device, unlike the modem which has a unique public IP. In this case, the router brings the Internet to our devices and is capable of creating a LAN network.
