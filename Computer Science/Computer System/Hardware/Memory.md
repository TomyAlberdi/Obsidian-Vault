Memory is the device that retains, memorizes, or stores computer data for some period of time. In this sense, it provides one of the main functions of computers because it stores information and knowledge. Interconnected to the CPU and input/output devices, it implements the fundamental part of the Von Neumann architecture computer model. It is divided into two types:
- **[[Main Memory]]**: Prioritizes speed over storage.
- **[[Secondary Memory]]**: Prioritizes storage capacity.

### Numerical System:
A numerical system is a set of symbols and generation rules that allow constructing all valid numbers of the system.
#### Types of Numerical Systems:
- **Non-positional Numerical System**: These are systems in which the value of the symbols that compose the system is fixed and does not depend on the position, for example, the Roman system.
- **Positional Numerical System**: These are systems in which the value of the symbol depends on the value assigned to them and their position.
### Base and Digit:
A digit is defined as each of the different symbols that constitute the numerical system. The base of the numerical system is the number of digits that form it. Example: Our system is formed by ten symbols, the digits from 0 to 9. Therefore, we are dealing with a base-10 system. Once the number of digits forming the numerical system is exhausted, quantities greater than the base are obtained by adequately combining the different digits of the system. This makes each digit adopt different values depending on its position:
```
3434 = 3000 + 400 + 30 + 4
```
A clearer way is to express the number based on its base 10:
```
3434 = (3 * 10⌃3) + (4 * 10⌃2) + (3 * 10⌃1) + (4 * 10⌃0)
```
Decimal numbers can also be expressed in a positional system:
```
3434.25 = (3 * 10⌃3) + (4 * 10⌃2) + (3 * 10⌃1) + (4 * 10⌃0) + (2 * 10⌃-1) + (2 * 10⌃-2)
```
### Binary System:
It is a numerical system that consists of two symbols, the digits are represented using two figures: 0 and 1.
