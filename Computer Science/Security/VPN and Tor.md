## VPN
A Virtual Private Network is a technology that protects our privacy when using the Internet by directing our connection through a server that hides the IP (Internet Protocol) address and encrypts online communication. When using a VPN, the information sent from the computer passes through one of the VPN provider's servers before reaching its destination.
**Advantages:**
- Easy to install and use.
- Speed: Not affected by encryption software and servers.
- Compatibility with most devices.

**Disadvantages:**
- Weak encryption.
- Software failures: This can cause messages to travel unencrypted and outside the VPN network.
- Varied logging policies.
## Tor
At first glance, the Tor network is similar to a VPN. Messages to and from your computer pass through the Tor network instead of connecting directly to Internet resources. But where VPNs provide privacy, Tor provides anonymity.
**Advantages:**
- Difficult to shut down: The network is distributed, so there is no central place to do so.
- Complete or near-complete anonymity.

**Disadvantages:**
- Slowness: Messages pass through 3 or more servers and are encrypted and decrypted at least 3 times.
- Run by volunteers: Therefore, there is no income for updates and maintenance.
- Low compatibility with devices.
