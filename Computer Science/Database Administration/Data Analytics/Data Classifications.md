Knowing our data allows us to:
- **Get more value from the data**: Processing time will be reduced when applying analytics, and we minimize the likelihood of errors.
- **Access data more efficiently**: We can join different tables and have all the necessary data for our analysis.
- **Contextualize the data**: Provide clearer context to the data, enabling us to explore and identify which transformations will be necessary.
## Classifications
**According to their nature**: The first step is to understand how we are going to interpret each piece of data available in our database.
- **Qualitative or categorical**: These allow us to describe objects and can be:
    - **Nominal**: Provide information to distinguish objects (e.g., postal code, eye color, gender).
    - **Ordinal**: Assign an order to objects (e.g., student performance, product satisfaction).
- **Quantitative or numerical**: These are the actual values in our dataset:
    - **Interval**: Their values represent magnitudes (e.g., temperature, exam scores).
    - **Ratio**: Allow data to be compared to reference points (e.g., length, time).
### Numerical types based on the number of values they can contain:
- **Discrete**: A record with a finite number of values. These can be categorical, such as postal codes, or numerical.
- **Continuous**: Real numbers, with no limit on the number of values. In this case, we only have numerical data, like the weight of an item.
## Power BI Data Types
- **Decimal number**: The most commonly used for numerical variables.
- **Fixed decimal number**: Adaptation for working with complex numbers.
- **Whole number**: A rounded numerical value, without decimals.
- **Date/Time**
- **Date**
- **Time**
- **Text**
- **True/False**
- **Binary**
