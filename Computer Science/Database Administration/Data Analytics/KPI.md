**"What is not measured cannot be improved. What is not improved always degrades."**

KPI stands for **Key Performance Indicator**. These are the most relevant metrics for your strategy, determining your success or failure. Having well-defined KPIs is a fundamental part of a company’s management strategy.
KPIs are the key performance indicators observed by a business:
- They are **fundamental quantitative values** that measure the company’s main processes.
- They are an essential component of any company’s management strategy.
- They allow for **tracking and better management** of the performance and success of strategies.
- With KPIs, companies can understand the status of various metrics and set **plausible and achievable goals**.
## Examples
1. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** If the CAC is high in an organization, managers know they need to closely monitor processes in Marketing and Sales.
2. **Retention Ratio:** If retention is low, managers should focus on customer service stages.
There are thousands of indicators that can be measured. In today’s world, the flow of information is immense and constant. The key is to choose the best indicators for measurement.
- A KPI can be a number or a percentage.
- A management indicator should inform, control, evaluate, and assist in decision-making.
- KPIs help measure the **quantitative performance** of processes.
## Characteristics
- **Time-bound:** KPIs must be measurable over time. For example, you might want to measure daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually.
- **Measurable:** As metrics, their key feature is being measurable in units.
- **Quantifiable:** If it’s measurable, it can be quantified. For instance, monetary units can be quantified in € or $. Many KPIs are also measured in percentages.
- **Specific:** KPIs must focus on a single aspect to measure; they must be concrete.
- **Verifiable:** Only those factors that are relevant to the business are useful.
## Defining a KPI
To identify, select, and correctly work with key factors for setting up the right management indicators for your company, follow this method by answering the following questions:
- What do we want to measure?
- Why are we measuring this data?
- Does it track the results of one of our objectives?
- Is it a key factor for the company?
- Who is responsible for monitoring it?
- How often should it be monitored?
## Why KPIs Matter
Organizations must make decisions constantly, and without knowing the current situation, it’s hard to make good decisions. Management indicators are valuable tools for **monitoring and controlling the planning of actions and objectives**. They help prioritize actions and measure the degree of success for each one.
It’s also important to **carefully select KPIs** to avoid the mistake of trying to measure everything. It’s essential to learn how to discard indicators that are not relevant to your goals.
