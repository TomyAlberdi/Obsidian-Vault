## Types of Cloud Databases
There are various types of cloud databases, each designed to meet specific needs and handle particular workloads. For example, some databases are built for transaction management, others for running large-scale internet applications, and others serve as data warehouses for analytics.
As commercial and enterprise databases evolved, they began to incorporate multiple data models and access methods within a single database management system. Today, there is a trend toward **multimodel databases**, which allow users to handle different types of workloads from a single underlying database.
## Primary Deployment Models
### Traditional Model:
This model is similar to a locally managed database, except the infrastructure is provisioned in the cloud.
- The organization purchases virtual machine space from a cloud service provider and deploys the database in the cloud.
- Developers or traditional IT staff use DevOps models to control the database.
- The organization is responsible for monitoring and managing the database.
### Database as a Service (DBaaS):
In this model, the organization subscribes to a cloud service provider via a paid subscription.
- The service provider handles various operational, maintenance, administrative, and real-time database management tasks.
- DBaaS typically automates provisioning, backups, scaling, high availability, security, updates, and health monitoring.
- This model offers maximum value to organizations by outsourcing database management, allowing companies to focus on their core business rather than managing internal database experts.
## Benefits
- **Enhanced Agility and Innovation**: Cloud databases can be configured and decommissioned quickly, facilitating rapid development and scaling.
- **Reduced Time to Market**: No need to request hardware or wait for shipping, installation, and network setup when a new product is in development.
- **Reduced Risk**: Cloud service providers leverage automation to implement best practices and security features, minimizing operational risks.
- **Lower Costs**: Pay-as-you-go subscription models and dynamic scaling allow organizations to provision for steady-state operations and scale up during peak demand, then scale back down afterward.
