When automating infrastructure, it's common to use different cloud providers or a combination of **cloud** and **on-premise** (your own datacenter) solutions. Various tools, often using **JSON** or **YAML** syntax, help manage infrastructure across multiple providers or efficiently within a single provider.
You can choose the tool that provides the **greatest efficiency** for your infrastructure needs. Let’s explore some of the most popular technologies for managing infrastructure as code (IaC). Knowing this information helps you select the best tool for your specific use case.
## Popular IaC tools:
### Terraform:
- **Developer**: Open-source tool developed by **HashiCorp**.
- **Features**: Terraform is a declarative provisioning and orchestration tool that allows you to automate every aspect of your infrastructure, whether it's in the **cloud** or on **on-premise** datacenters.
- **Key Advantage**: It can check the state of infrastructure before applying changes, ensuring safe updates.
- **Why Popular**: Terraform is compatible with all cloud providers without needing to modify your templates, making it extremely versatile.
### AWS CloudFormation:
- **Developer**: **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.
- **Features**: CloudFormation is AWS's native solution for provisioning resources. It supports defining templates in **JSON** or **YAML** format and allows for the creation, updating, and deletion of resources as many times as necessary.
- **Key Advantage**: Full integration with all AWS services, making it the best choice if you're exclusively using AWS as your cloud provider.
### Azure Resource Manager:
- **Developer**: **Microsoft Azure**.
- **Features**: Azure's native IaC tool, **ARM Templates**, uses declarative syntax in **JSON** format to define resources and their properties.
- **Key Advantage**: Native support for managing Azure infrastructure efficiently using templates that ensure consistency and repeatability.
### Google Cloud Deployment Manager:
- **Developer**: **Google Cloud**.
- **Features**: Similar to CloudFormation for AWS, Google Cloud Deployment Manager is Google's IaC tool, allowing users to manage infrastructure using configuration files in **YAML** format.
- **Key Advantage**: Seamless integration with Google Cloud services, making it ideal for Google Cloud users.
### Ansible:
- **Developer**: **Red Hat**.
- **Features**: Ansible is an infrastructure automation tool that models your infrastructure by describing how its components interact with each other, rather than managing systems independently. It uses **YAML** for configurations and is agentless, meaning you don’t need to install additional software on target machines.
- **Key Advantage**: Ansible’s simplicity and ability to handle configuration management, software deployment, and infrastructure provisioning across diverse environments make it a versatile choice for both cloud and on-premise setups.
