When we talk about **collaboration** in terms of files, the first things that may come to mind are platforms like **Dropbox** or **Google Drive**. These systems are easy to use, feature intuitive interfaces, and offer basic file control. However, when working in the tech industry, these tools often fall short in meeting the specific demands of software development. The software industry requires tools that can:
- Update code in real-time.
- Handle conflicts in code.
- Offer roadmaps to plan and set milestones.
- Synchronize file versions.
- Store large amounts of files.
- Automate build processes.
These requirements are handled by specific products designed for software collaboration. Letâ€™s explore some of the most well-known tools that address these needs:
## GitHub
- **Description**: GitHub is a **remote repository** and **version control** service for collaborating on software code projects.
- **Key Features**:
    - **GitHub Issues**: Acts as a **ticketing tool** for managing tasks and bug reports.
    - **Boards**: Allows tracking and managing the status of created issues.
    - Popular for **open-source projects** and integrates well with CI/CD tools.
## GitLab
- **Description**: Like GitHub, GitLab is a **repository tool** for software collaboration, allowing teams to work together on projects.
- **Key Features**:
    - **Self-hosting**: GitLab can be run locally, and there are **Docker-certified images** that make installation simple.
    - **CI/CD Pipelines**: GitLab offers built-in **Continuous Integration (CI)** functionality for creating pipelines to automate code updates and deployments.
    - Useful for both private projects and large-scale software development teams.
## BitBucket
- **Description**: Another **repository** platform for software collaboration, very similar to GitHub and GitLab, but it does not offer a free tier.
- **Key Features**:
    - **Atlassian Integration**: As part of the **Atlassian suite**, BitBucket integrates seamlessly with **Jira** and other Atlassian products, streamlining project management.
    - **Boards**: Includes tracking boards for managing issues, just like GitHub and GitLab.
