Java is a general-purpose programming language. This means it can be used for various purposes. With Java, we can access databases, communicate between devices, capture data, perform mathematical calculations, etc. Additionally, it is a high-level language because it is closer to human language than machine language. For this reason, Java is easier to read, write, and maintain by a person. In general, this type of language allows for fewer lines of code compared to low-level languages. It also allows writing executable code on different types of computers and operating systems and generally employs programming paradigms. Java is a programming language that uses the object-oriented programming paradigm. This means that the code represents an abstraction of real-life elements. This allows for the development of complex systems quickly and adaptably, and they are easy to understand. On the other hand, Java is also a strongly typed language, which means that data type violations are not allowed. That is, given the value of a variable of a specific type, it cannot be used as if it were of another type unless a conversion is made.
### Functionality:
Java is a compiled and interpreted language. This is important because it provides platform independence. This means that our program, once compiled, can be executed on any operating system, as long as we have the interpreter.
- **Compiler**: Translates our high-level code into a lower-level language called Java Bytecode, packaging our program for distribution.
- **Interpreter**: Java Virtual Machine allows interpreting and executing these instructions on any operating system.
