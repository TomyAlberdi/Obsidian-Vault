In 2007, Netflix embarked on a long journey toward fully operating in the cloud. Much of its backend applications were developed in Java, and as part of this process, Netflix created several libraries:
- **Ribbon** (load balancing)
- **Eureka** (service discovery)
- **Hystrix** (fault tolerance)
All of these began to be open-sourced around 2012.
In 2015, **Spring Cloud Netflix 1.0** was launched. This was a community effort to integrate Netflix's components using **Spring Boot**.
By 2018, Netflix transitioned to **Spring Boot**, making it the company's primary framework. **Spring Cloud Netflix** provides a set of frameworks and libraries to address large-scale distributed system challenges.
