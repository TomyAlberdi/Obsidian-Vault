## Types of Cyber Threats
Malware means Malicious Software and is used to describe any software that aims to infiltrate or damage an information system without the user's consent, bypassing [[cybersecurity]]. For malware to achieve its goal, it is essential that it remains hidden from the user, as the user will try to eliminate it if detected. This term is very broad and includes concepts such as viruses, trojans, worms, etc.
#### Virus:
This type of malware aims to remain in a system by copying itself in various places from the moment it is executed in the system. Thus, when an infected file or program is attempted to be removed, the virus will remain in memory as it has infected other parts of the system. The goal of a virus can vary, but essentially it will try to destroy or disable files or programs on the device, as well as affect its operation. Most viruses attach to executable files or the master boot record and cannot spread to other devices unless done manually through hardware. Therefore, they are said to have low infection rates, as they replicate within a single device.
#### Worms:
This malware not only copies itself within the system but also uses the network to copy itself to other devices through vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is said to have a higher infection capacity. The goal of these worms is to multiply themselves until they saturate the system's operation.
#### Trojans:
They do not cause damage by themselves but are used to load hidden files such as viruses, worms, or other malware onto a device. They require user execution as they cannot multiply themselves. This type of malware also has the ability to create backdoors, which  allow a device to be remotely controlled by someone else. They can be used as a proxy server to avoid attacks or, more commonly, to introduce spam to our device.
#### Adware:
Their goal is to bombard our device with advertisements. They are not harmful by themselves and are usually within trojans.
#### Spyware:
This malware does not damage devices but steals all the system's information. Its goal is to remain hidden to steal all kinds of data, from passwords, banking information, images, among others. They can also access the device's camera or microphone without the user noticing. Spyware is usually within trojans or installed. An example of spyware is the keylogger, which records everything the user types through the keyboard to obtain sensitive information.
#### Rootkits:
This is a special set of software. Other malware attacks the device's operating system, so if the system is reinstalled, the malware disappears. A rootkit, on the other hand, targets the system's firmware, giving it access to the device's kernel. This access allows it to make modifications to the operating system's internal processes, records, and even user accounts. Moreover, due to this, they manage to hide from antivirus software.
#### Botnets:
It is a network of bots set up by an attacker on a network of computers to be controlled simultaneously. They are generally used to commit digital crimes, such as identity or banking information theft, extortion, among others. Trojans are usually the main cause of botnet propagation.
#### Ransomware:
It means kidnapping software and is often used by attackers against companies to hijack information about their services or products and demand money in exchange for the ransom. The attacker makes the extortion evident and usually asks for a password to regain access to the system. This type of malware is often found in email attachments or by clicking on links that claim to come from a bank or legal entity. They are also found on file-sharing networks, such as P2P.
