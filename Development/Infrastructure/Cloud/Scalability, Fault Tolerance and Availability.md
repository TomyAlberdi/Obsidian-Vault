## Scalability
Scalability refers to the ability of a system to grow in response to increasing demand. For example, if you have 1000 users and suddenly that number doubles up to 2000, cloud scalability refers to the cloud's ability to increase its capacity. Scalability also includes **elasticity**, which is the ability to both grow and shrink based on resource demand. Elastic infrastructures automatically adjust to save resources, and when using elastic services, the cloud should charge based on actual usage, ensuring there are no charges for unused resources.
## Fault Tolerance
Fault tolerance refers to a system's ability to continue functioning despite errors or failures. A fault-tolerant service can handle a certain level of issues by either fixing problems or replacing malfunctioning elements with operational ones. For instance, in a local [[network]] connected to a multi-port switch, if one port fails, the network continues to operate using the remaining [[ports]].
## Availability
**High availability** means that multiple resources are in place to ensure continuous service even if one resource fails. For example, if one server fails but others can take over, the system is considered highly available. On the other hand, if a critical resource cannot be replaced, it indicates **low availability**.
