The current model of atomic structure is the **quantum mechanical model**. Traditional chemistry starts with the study of **elementary particles, atoms, molecules, substances, metals, crystals** and other aggregates of **matter**. Matter can be studied in solid, liquid, gas and plasma **states**, in isolation or in combination. The interactions, reactions and transformations that are studied in chemistry are usually the result of interactions between atoms, leading to rearrangements of the chemical bonds which hold atoms together. Such behaviors are studied in a chemistry laboratory.
