Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter. It is a physical science within the natural sciences that studies the **chemical elements** that make up matter and **compounds** made of **attoms**, **molecules**, and **ions**: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during **reactions with other substances**. Chemistry also addresses the nature of **chemical bonds** in chemical compounds.
## Branches
### Physical Chemistry:
Study of the physical and fundamental basis of chemical systems and processes. In particular, the energetics and dynamics of such systems and processes are of interest to physical chemists. Prominent fields include:
- **Chemical kinetics**: Study of rates of chemical processes.
- **Chemical physics**: Investigates physicochemical phenomena using techniques from atomic and molecular physics and condensed matter physics; it is the branch of physics that studies chemical processes.
- **Electrochemistry**: Branch of chemistry that studies chemical reeactions which take place in a solution at the interface of an electron conductor (the electrode: a metal or a semiconductor) and an ionic conductor (the electrolyte), and which involve electron transfer between the electrode and the electrolyte or species in solution.
- **Geochemistry**: Chemical study of the mechanisms behind major systems studiend in geology.
- **Thermochemistry**: The branch of chemistry that studies the relation between chemical action and the amount of heat absorbed or generated.
### Organic Chemistry:
Study of the structure, properties, composition, mechanisms and reactions of organic compounds. An organic compound is defined as any compound based on a carbon skeleton. Includes:
- **Biochemistry**: Study of the chemicals, chemical reactions and chemical interactions that take place in living organisms.
- **Medicinal chemistry**: Discipline which applies chemistry for medicinal or drug related purposes.
### Inorganic Chemistry:
Study of the properties and reactions of inorganic compounds. The distinction between organic and inorganic disciplines is not absolute and there is much overlap, most importantly in the subdiscipline of **organometallic chemistry**. Includes:
- **Bioinorganic chemistry**: Is a field that examines the role of metals in biology.
### Nuclear Chemistry:
Study of how subatomic particles come together and make nuclei. Modern Transmutation is a large component of nuclear chemistry, and the table of nuclides is an important result and tool for this field.
