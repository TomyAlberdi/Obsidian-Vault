# Components
To better understand what Data Analytics entails, we need to explain each of its components:
## Immersion
Understand the model, problem, or business process to which we want to apply Data Analytics.
### Understand the problem:
Having a general view of the problem where we will apply Data Analytics helps us determine the type of solution we need to implement and the strategy to follow.
### Know the business:
We must understand the business or domain in which we will be addressing Data Analytics solutions. This will help us enhance the knowledge generated through data exploitation.
### Understand the data model.
### Define the strategy:
This stage is crucial in any Data Analytics process. It will help ensure that our data-based product (Dashboard, Exploratory Analysis, Predictive Model) has a meaningful impact on the business where it will be implemented.
## Measurement Strategy
In the analytical process, the first step is understanding the model, problem, or business process to which we want to apply Data Analytics. Once this is done, we need to define the measurement strategy we'll use. This involves defining business objectives and results (OKRs), indicators (KPIs), and dimensions.
## Technical Implementation
The third step involves the technical implementation of Data Analytics. This is done through an iterative process that includes three phases:
### Data Modeling:
Techniques for building data models to generate a better understanding of the domain being analyzed and to facilitate access to it. It can also serve as input for a Machine Learning model.
### Data Manipulation:
Refers to the techniques that allow us to prepare the data for analysis.
### Data Visualization:
This is the graphical representation of information and data, making it easier to understand.
## Information Analysis and Results Generation
Data exploration to generate insights and findings.
## Knowledge Generation
Based on the insights and findings, factual knowledge is generated. The goal is to either confirm or discard hypotheses and adjust measurement strategies.
# Conclusion
## Definition
Data Analytics refers to a set of quantitative and qualitative techniques and processes used for decision-making, with the goal of improving a businessâ€™s productivity and profits by leveraging insights extracted from data.
## What does a Data Analyst do?
Data analysts aim to determine how data can be used to answer questions and solve problems. They study current trends to identify patterns and make predictions about the future.
## Tasks involved in the role of Data Analytics:
- Collaborating with technology, management, and/or data science teams to set goals.
- Mining data from primary and secondary sources.
- Cleaning and dissecting data.
- Analyzing and interpreting results using statistical tools and techniques.
- Identifying trends and patterns in data sets.
- Identifying new opportunities for process improvement.
- Providing data reports for management.
- Designing, creating, and maintaining databases and data systems.
- Troubleshooting code and data-related issues.
