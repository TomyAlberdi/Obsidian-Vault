**Power BI** is a business analytics service created by Microsoft. Its goal is to enable users to create their own reports and dashboards. Power BI offers interactive visualizations and business intelligence features with a simple interface.
It is a collection of services, apps, and software connectors that work together to transform non-relational data sources into coherent, compelling, and interactive insights.
## Power Query
Power Query is the data transformation and preparation mechanism within Power BI. It includes a graphical interface for retrieving data from various sources and an editor for applying transformations.
With Power Query, you can execute the **ETL process** (Extract, Transform, Load) in Power BI. As discussed earlier, ETL is commonly used to build a data warehouse, thus maintaining, optimizing, and simplifying current operations.
During this process, data is:
- **Extracted** from a source system.
- **Transformed** into a standardized format that can be analyzed.
- **Loaded** into a data model in Power BI for further analysis.
