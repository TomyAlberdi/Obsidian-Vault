Before starting our **Data Analytics** process, it is very useful to explore the data. This preliminary investigation helps us gain a better understanding of the datasets, allowing us to apply necessary transformations and maximize the value of our analysis. Additionally, it can be used to evaluate the results of data analysis. This process is often referred to as **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**.
## Types of Exploration
- **Summarization**: This involves summarizing the data through specific metrics that capture the characteristics of large datasets. For example, a table with the average age of residents by city.
- **Visualization**: This is the graphical or tabular representation of data. Visualization is extremely useful for interpreting large volumes of data by any audience.
### Advantages of Visualization
Visualizations are highly beneficial for:
- Assisting with **Data Manipulation** processes and analyzing the results of an analysis.
- Improving the quality of data analysis, though they donâ€™t replace **Data Analytics** techniques.
- Making data interpretation accessible to anyone involved in the project.
- Helping reach quick and accurate conclusions.
## Key Concepts
- **Frequency**: The number of occurrences of a certain value within the dataset, i.e., how often a specific value repeats.
- **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value in the dataset, which will have the highest frequency.
- **Average**: A representative number that seeks to illustrate the values in a dataset. It may also be referred to as the **mean** or **arithmetic mean**.
- **Percentile**: The maximum value within a certain percentage of the dataset. It indicates up to what value a specific X% of the dataset is contained.
- **Median**: The middle value of the dataset, also known as the 50th percentile.
