#Theory 
Currently, there are many [[database]] management systems (DBMS), more commonly known as database "engines." Below are the most used ones and their most well-known graphical interface tools.
### MySQL
#### MySQL Workbench:
The engine and graphical interface used throughout the course.
#### phpMyAdmin:
Apart from Workbench, the most used graphical interface. This is the classic PHP client, which is installed alongside MySQL servers. It is not a desktop tool but a web interface for data management. With this tool, we have the same functionality as with Workbench. We can create, modify, delete, and query databases, tables, fields, among others.
### [[SQL]] Server
#### SQL Server Management Studio:
Provided by Microsoft, it is a relational database management system based on the Transact-SQL language, capable of providing large amounts of data to many users simultaneously.
#### Visual Studio Code:
From VS Code, we can work with Microsoft SQL Server databases. By just installing an extension, we can work with both the source code and the database management in a single tool.
### Oracle
#### Oracle SQL Developer:
Traditionally, Oracle has been the DBMS par excellence for the business world, always considered the most complete and robust. Unlike MySQL, its main options are paid, although it has a free version with restrictions.
#### DataGrip:
We can also choose to use the Oracle engine with DataGrip. The latter can connect to any DBMS as long as it has a JDBC driver. This means it supports multiple databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL, among others.
### MariaDB
#### Navicat:
MariaDB is a derivative of MySQL that has most of its features. It was born from Oracle's acquisition of MySQL to continue the Open Source philosophy and has the advantage of being fully compatible with MySQL. Navicat for MariaDB provides a native environment for the management and development of MariaDB databases.
### SQLite
#### DB Browser:
More than a database management system as such, SQLite is a library written in C that implements a DBMS and allows transactions without the need for a server or configurations. It is a free and open-source application designed to facilitate the creation and management of SQLite databases.
### PostgreSQL
#### pgAdmin:
This object-relational database management system is free, published under the BSD license. pgAdmin is the most popular and feature-complete open-source development and administration platform for PostgreSQL.
