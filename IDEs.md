#Theory 
An IDE or Integrated [[Software|Development]] Environment possesses many more tools that are integrated into a single program. Their main characteristic is that they do not work with files and folders, as they use the concept of projects instead. A project is a folder on the hard drive, but with the difference that the IDE creates additional files to the code to optimize the user experience. These files can have execution configurations, deployment, project type, etc.
Because IDEs are very complex platforms, it is possible to do countless things, and the plugins they offer are practically unlimited. The most notable features of an IDE are:
- Real-time debugger.
- Graphically visualize almost anything, from XML, JSON, UML, databases, graphical interfaces, etc.
- Real-time help.
