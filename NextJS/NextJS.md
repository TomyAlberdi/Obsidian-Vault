Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and NextJS for additional features and optimizations.
It also automatically configures lower-level tools like bundlers and compilers. You can instead focus on building your product and shipping quickly.
Wether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, NextJS can help you build interactive, dynamic and fast React Applications.
