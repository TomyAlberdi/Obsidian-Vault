**Debugging** refers to the process of identifying, analyzing, and removing the causes of software failures. This involves executing each instruction step by step to analyze variables and their values.
## Debugging a Software Application
Debugging can be done using:
- Developer tools from the browser console (e.g., **Chrome Dev Tools**, **Firefox Dev Tools**).
- The **Debug** option within the framework or **IDE** used for development.
### Breakpoints:
A **breakpoint** is a point in the code where execution is paused on specific lines to analyze the state of the program, such as the values of variables or the call stack at that moment.
### Debugging in Dev Tools:
To use debugging in the browser, access the **Dev Tools** and go to the **Sources** tab. This section contains a file navigator, a code editor, and a JavaScript debugger. Set a breakpoint on the relevant line by clicking on the line number.
The debug mode is initialized by some action, such as clicking a button. From there, you can use the following key commands:
- **F11**: Step through the code line by line.
- **F8**: Jump between breakpoints.
You can also use the commands available in the interface:
- **Continue**: Continues code execution to the next breakpoint.
- **Step Over**: Executes the next line of code. If it's a function, it executes and returns the result without stepping inside.
- **Step Into**: Executes the next line of code. If it's a function, it steps into the function and debugs line by line.
- **Step Out**: Returns control to the line where the function was called.
- **Restart**: Restarts the debugger.
- **Stop**: Stops the debugging session.
### Debugging in VS Code:
To debug in **VSCode**, navigate to the functionality you want to debug via the file explorer. Set a breakpoint on the desired line and start debugging with **F5** or **Run ‚ûù Start Debugging**.
If it's your first time debugging in the application, go to **Add Configuration** in the menu and add the **Chrome** configuration to execute the application. This creates a `launch.json` file where you configure the `file` attribute with the path to the HTML file that starts the application. Since **Chrome** is used for debugging, an action within the application will need to trigger the debugging process.
## Differences between debugging and Testing

| Deductive process to correct errors found during testing.                                                                                                  | Process where the system or component is tested to ensure that it works as expected. Its objective is to search for errors. |
| It allows to provide a solution to the code failure.                                                                                                       | Allows to identify flaws in the implemented code.                                                                           |
| Generally performed by the programmer or developer, with the exception of code generated by the tester as part of automatic test scripts.                  | Usually performed by the tester.                                                                                            |
| It cannot be done without the proper design knowledge.                                                                                                     | No design knowledge is required in the testing process.                                                                     |
| It is performed only by an intern. Generally, an outsider cannot debug because he/she does not have access to the code.                                    | It can be performed by both interns and externs.                                                                            |
| Made manually.                                                                                                                                             | It may be manual or automated.                                                                                              |
| Based on debugging strategies, such as brute force debugging, bug tracking, cause elimination, automated debugging using tools and the eyes of a coworker. | Based on different levels of testing, i.e. component, integration, system and acceptance testing.                           |
| It is not a stage of the software development life cycle, it occurs as a consequence of testing.                                                           | It is a stage of the software development life cycle (SDLC).                                                                |
| It seeks to match the symptom with the cause, leading to error correction.                                                                                 | Composed of software validation and verification.                                                                           |
| It starts with code execution due to a failed test case.                                                                                                   | Started before having the code (static testing) or after writing the code (dynamic testing).                                |
