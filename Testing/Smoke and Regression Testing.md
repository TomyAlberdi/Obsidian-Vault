**Smoke testing** and **regression testing** are two of the most important types of tests (Testing) conducted throughout the development of a system. Both are essential for maintaining the health of the product under development and are crucial to the final quality of the product.
- **Smoke testing** is executed to evaluate the stability of initial or newly developed software builds.
- **Regression testing** is responsible for verifying and validating the existing functionalities of the application after every modification or addition of new features.
Smoke testing is conducted before regression testing. If any issues are found during smoke testing, it indicates that the build is not stable, and it is sent back to the development team until stability is achieved. Once the system reaches a stable version, regression testing is performed on the existing functionalities according to the planned schedule.
