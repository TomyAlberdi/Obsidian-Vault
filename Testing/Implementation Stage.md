In the **test implementation (Software Testing Lifecycle > Implementation) stage**, the key question to answer is: _Is everything ready to conduct the test?_ This stage involves several key activities, including creating and/or completing the necessary work products for test execution, preparing the test environment (including data or configurations), and organizing test suites within an execution schedule, among others.
Once the implementation of changes or new functionalities requested by the client is complete, and the corresponding test cases have been designed, the next step is the **test execution stage** within the software development life cycle (SDLC). The tasks involved in execution are carried out iteratively until the system is as stable as possible.
## Test Execution
During the test execution phase, test suites are executed after changes are deployed in the test environments as part of the planned development within a sprint. The key activities involved in test execution include:

- Recording the **identifiers** and versions of test elements or objects, test tools, and test products.
- Executing tests **manually** or using test execution tools.
- Comparing the **actual results** with the **expected results**.
- Analyzing anomalies to determine their **probable causes**.
- Reporting defects based on observed failures.
- Recording the **results of the test execution**.
- Repeating testing activities, either as a result of an action taken for an anomaly or as part of the **planned testing**.

This iterative process helps ensure that the system reaches a high level of stability before moving forward.
