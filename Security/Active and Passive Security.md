Information security consists of all the actions we take to protect the integrity and privacy of data and all the information stored in a computer system. To protect our Computer, we have two types of security: active and passive.
## Active Security
The elements called active contain information. These can take many forms: servers, mobile devices, databases, among others. These assets contain information that someone wants to compromise, obtain, destroy, etc. Since their intention is to access the information, they will do so through a vulnerability (Bugs and Vulnerabilities > Vulnerabilities)â€”a problem that systems containing information have. The threat exploits that vulnerability to improperly access the information and do whatever they want. Active security protects and prevents damage to computer systems.
#### Best practices:
- Proper use and management of passwords. One technique for a secure password is the combination of letters, numbers, uppercase letters, and symbols. Do not use pet names or birth dates, among other data that may be publicly known.
- Use of security software, such as antivirus, antispyware, and firewalls.
- Encrypt important data. Encryption involves encoding data or information using an encryption algorithm with a key so that the data/information can only be read if the encryption key is known.
## Passive Security
It is a set of security actions or techniques that come into play to minimize damage to computer systems. These actions are activated when malware or any other threat has been introduced into the system.
#### Best practices:
- Make backups of data on more than one device or in different physical locations.
- Continuously scan and clean equipment to control and prevent malware attacks.
- Create partitions on the hard drive to store files and backups on a different unit from where the operating system is located.
- In the event of an attack, disconnect the equipment from the network until the issue can be resolved. 
- It is important that when there is a virus infection, it is verified that the antivirus works correctly.
