## Control
When we talk about control, we often find many definitions. The RAE (Royal Spanish Academy) defines it as verification, inspection, supervision, and intervention. In other sources, we can find that it is the set of mechanisms, actions, and tools used to detect the presence of errors. However, in this subject, we will refer to control as a process that consists of a parity between one result and another. Many times it is thought that Information security only consists of implementing technical controls. But for this security to be comprehensive over computer equipment and software, some administrative and physical controls must also be implemented. Below, we will see some of these types of controls.
### Proactive security measures:
- **Directives:** They tell us what we can or cannot do. They try to ensure that system activities are carried out in a specific way to produce certain expected results.
- **Deterrents:** They can divert the intention of a potential attacker or misuse by staff. They differ from directives in that they do not directly restrict us but rather give us a warning, which may or may not be taken into account when performing the improper action.
- **Preventive:** They seek to prevent an accident or any type of improper action in the systems. The difference with deterrents is that these seek to inform and prevent improper action.
### Reactive security measures:
- **Detectives:** They are based on searching for potential attacks or dangers to which a computer system may be exposed.
- **Correctives:** Once the risk has been found or an incident has occurred that has endangered the data or information, these security measures are activated. Their objective is to fix the system after the deviation has occurred.
## Audit
Auditing is the action of thoroughly and deeply analyzing the different characteristics and areas of an organization. In computing, the auditor is responsible for analyzing and determining that all the organization's information works efficiently.
#### Objectives of information systems auditing:
- **Efficiency:** Work must be done so that the information gathered is useful for decision-making.
- **Regulations:** The regulations determined must be complied with to certify that the company works under standard norms.
- **Resource management:** Resources are used correctly.
#### Knowledge of the IT auditor:
- **Efficiency:** Experience in project management.
- **Regulations:** Knowledge of software and regulations.
- **Resource management:** Knowledge of infrastructure.
#### Auditor:
Most auditors work in small groups of up to 4 people and are the direct link with the various departments and management. The IT auditor will reflect in a final report all the weaknesses, opportunities for improvement, and recommendations so that the organization, without being mandatory, decides whether to accept them or not.
#### Tools for auditing:
- **Interviews:** Through interviews with staff, determine if they are aware of and use the company's established norms in their daily work.
- **Surveys:** They serve to have a general overview of the company's state.
- **Process analysis:** Companies should have their various processes documented so that the auditor can review that they meet the established standards.
- **Software code analysis:** Through various tests or syntax analysis, auditors ensure that the guidelines for Software development are met.
