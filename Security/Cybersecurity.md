Computer security focuses on the protection of computer infrastructure and everything related to it, especially the information transmitted through computer networks (Network). To minimize all risks to infrastructure and information, multiple methods have been created throughout history, such as standards, protocols, rules, tools, and obviously, computer laws. We must keep in mind that computer security will only focus on the communication medium through which the information will travel. We should not confuse this term with information security, as the latter can be in different media and not just in computer media. Under this last concept, computer security will identify, eliminate vulnerabilities, and protect against malicious attacks on computers, servers, computer networks, and any computer medium through which information is transmitted.
