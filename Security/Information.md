Information is a key resource for making decisions, assessing, and reducing risks. It has three dimensions known as integrity, availability, and confidentiality, also called CIA for their initials in English. Attackers of a system will try to compromise one of these dimensions.
#### Integrity:
Ensures that the information is complete and that the data within the system is as it should be. An example of this dimension would be an attack on a Database and the modification of the data within it, where we can still see the information, but it is incorrect.
#### Availability:
Means that a person/user must be able to access the information when they need it, that is, in a timely manner. A typical attack on this dimension is a denial-of-service attack.
#### Confidentiality:
Refers to the information being available only to those who have access to it and blocked for third parties. For example, personal data and medical records.

## Information Protection
Information protection is based on ensuring the complete and total functioning of the three dimensions. To do this, preventive and reactive measures must be implemented. In computer systems, this is done through Cybersecurity.
- **Preventive measure**: One that can be taken to avoid unwanted problems.
- **Reactive measure**: One where a security problem has already occurred and needs to be resolved.
#### Integrity Protection:
- **Audits**: Reactive. Used to verify that the information matches what should be correct.
- **Version control**: Reactive. If an issue has occurred with the information, various version control tools help revert to a previous state.
- **Digital signatures**: Preventive. This measure ensures the authenticity of a document.
- **Intrusion detection**: Reactive. Designed to detect problems when unauthorized access has occurred.
#### Availability Protection:
- **Fault tolerance**: Preventive or reactive. The ability of systems or servers to ensure that if some type of failure occurs, the information can still be used.
- **Redundancy**: Preventive. This way, information and access validations are repeated so much that the information is safe from being completely lost.
- **Security patches**: Preventive and reactive. When a flaw is detected, the problem must be solved so it does not happen again. Likewise, if the flaw comes from software, update it with the resolved vulnerability.
#### Confidentiality Protection:
- **Encryption**: Preventive. Means changing the format of the data so that if intercepted, only authorized people know how to read it.
- **Access controls**: Preventive. Ensuring that only authorized people can access the information.
- **Remote wipe**: Reactive. Refers to the effort to keep data always private and, in case access is lost, having the ability to block the device or erase the information.
- **Staff training**: Preventive. There is a concept called social engineering, which refers to how users are deceived into giving up their access. Training on these issues is a preventive action to avoid them.
