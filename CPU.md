#Theory 
One could say that the CPU is the "brain" of a computer system as it controls the operation of all hardware and software. Indeed, it executes instructions stored as binary numbers organized in the main memory, so the more powerful a processor is, the faster it can perform operations and the faster a device will run overall. Among other qualities, it is also responsible for reading, interpreting, and processing instructions; first from the Operating System, and then from the programs or applications installed on the computer.
## Components
### Socket:
The CPU socket is used to fix and connect the processor without soldering it, which allows different models and families to be removed and installed without changing the motherboard. It handles all communications with the outside of the CPU. Depending on the number of connections, more integrated elements can be included and offer greater bandwidth to other system components. Generally, cell phones or laptops do not use a socket.
### Cores:
Cores are like a sub-processor in itself. Single-core processors cannot perform more than one task at a time. A dual-core CPU could perform two tasks simultaneously, a quad-core could perform four tasks simultaneously, and so on, correlatively with as many cores as it incorporates.
### Threads:
Threads are the program's control flow. They directly help the way a processor manages its tasks. Their function is to better utilize the "waiting times" between processes. Threads can make the user believe that more than one thing can be done at the same time by dividing the task into portions, alternating portions of tasks so that it seems they are executed simultaneously.
### Cache Memory:
Cache memory is the fastest memory in the system and is used to speed up access to the processor's memory. It stores the most frequently used data and instructions by the system to avoid wasting time accessing them in the RAM.
### Frequency or Clock:
The processor is governed by a clock that synchronizes its components and limits the operations it can perform in a certain amount of time. Frequency is the number of changes made in a given second.
## Performance:
There are more important parameters to measure the performance of a processor in operation. The one that is usually given the most importance is IPC or Instructions Per Cycle. IPC measures the number of instructions a processor can perform in each cycle of its internal clock. While a CPU with a faster clock speed can complete more cycles in a second, a CPU with a higher IPC but a lower frequency can be able to complete more tasks in a second.
