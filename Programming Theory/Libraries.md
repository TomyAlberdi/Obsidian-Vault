A library is simply a set of code that someone has created for us to reuse within our projects. The goal of a library is to make the development of certain functions within our program or application easier and faster. Libraries are usually focused on solving specific problems. That is, they do not provide a structure for our project but will help solve specific functionalities.
Examples:
- React
- Axios
- JUnit 5
