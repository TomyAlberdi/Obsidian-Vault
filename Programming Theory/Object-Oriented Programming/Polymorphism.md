Polymorphism is the ability of an object to behave as another. In other words, it is the capacity of an object to function in various forms. Letâ€™s look at the previous examples:
Example:
```java
Dog p;

p = new Doberman();
p.bark();

p = new Poodle();
p.bark();
```
The reference `p` can behave and bark like a `Doberman`. The same reference `p`, when dynamically bound (Dynamic Binding) to a `Poodle`, behaves and barks like a `Poodle`.
By using polymorphism, we can be confident that future modifications adding new subclasses should not affect the code or its functionality. If the code uses `Dog` (that is, any object that "is a" `Dog`), as long as new dog breeds introduced into the system inherit from `Dog`, they will work correctly.
### Casting:
Suppose `Doberman` has a method called `biteLikeDoberman()`, but the reference, i.e., the variable, is of type `Dog`. To force a dog to be treated as a `Doberman`, we use casting. This allows us to invoke methods specific to `Doberman`.
```java
Dog dog = new Doberman();
dog.bark();

((Doberman)dog).biteLikeDoberman();
```
The same applies if our object reference is of type `Object`. In this case, since the `Object` class does not have the `bark()` method, we must cast it to either `Dog` or `Doberman`.
Example:
```java
Object dog = new Doberman();

((Dog)dog).bark();

((Doberman)dog).biteLikeDoberman();
```
