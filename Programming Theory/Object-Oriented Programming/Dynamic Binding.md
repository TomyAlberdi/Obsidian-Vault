Dynamic binding of a reference works like a power outlet. You can plug different things into an outlet: a TV, a refrigerator, a laptop, etc. Similarly, a reference in programming can point to different types of objects.}
Example:
```java
Doberman dog = new Doberman();
```
Here, both the reference and the referenced object are of the same type: `Doberman`. However, it is possible for the reference and the referenced object to be of different types.
In loosely-typed languages, the reference and the object can be of any type. In strongly-typed languages like [[Java]], the object must be of a class that has an "is-a" relationship with the reference.
Example:
```java
Dog dog = new Doberman();
```
In this case, the reference is of a different type than the referenced object, but it satisfies the "is-a" condition: a `Doberman` "is a" `Dog`.
