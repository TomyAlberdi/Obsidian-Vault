Computational thinking is about the mental process through which a person poses a problem and for its possible solution uses a sequence of instructions executed by a [[Computer]], a human, or both. 

> Computational thinking involves solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behavior based on fundamental concepts of computer science. Computational thinking includes a range of mental tools that reflect the breadth of the field of computer science. 

To learn to program, we must structure our minds according to the [[Programming Paradigms|programming paradigm]]. For this, computational thinking is useful; it is a tool that we can add to our daily lives.
## Stages of Computational Thinking
1. **Decomposition**:
   It involves breaking down the problem into smaller units to make them easier to solve.
2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   After breaking down the complex problem, the smaller series are tackled individually. This allows them to be solved similarly to previously encountered problems.
3. **Abstraction**:
   This involves simplifying a complex problem by ignoring irrelevant data to define a concise plan.
4. **[[Algorithm]]**:
   It is a set of well-defined, ordered, and concrete instructions or rules that are unambiguous and allow carrying out a process for problem-solving.
