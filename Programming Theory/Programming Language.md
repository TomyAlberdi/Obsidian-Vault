Language is a system composed of signs that people use to communicate. Therefore, it wouldn't be so far-fetched to think about using a system to communicate with a computer.
Programming languages are the means through which we give instructions to the Computer to tell it what our program should do. These instructions consist of a series of steps (algorithms) that must be clear and precise, meaning they cannot contain ambiguities. For this reason, we cannot give instructions in our natural language; instead, we must do so through a formal language.
In relation to the above, we can classify programming languages according to various criteria. 
We find two large groups:
### Specific Languages:
They solve specific problems, such as a programming language for creating mathematical graphics.
### General Languages:
They allow the development of an infinite number of different applications almost regardless of the context, such as a website.
