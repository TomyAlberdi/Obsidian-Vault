The **pipeline** is a crucial component in automated software development. While the term has been used to describe various aspects of computing, in the **DevOps** industry, we use pipelines to represent the wide range of behaviors and processes involved in **continuous integration** (CI).
Let's focus on one key stage within a pipeline: the **build process**, which is the transformation of source code into a functional application that can be executed by users.
## Build Process
The **build** stage is essential in some programming languages, while in others, like **Python** and **JavaScript**, which are known as **interpreted languages**, this stage is not required. In interpreted languages, the source code is executed directly as is, at runtime, without needing to compile it first.
However, in **compiled languages**—such as **C**, **C++**, **C#**, and **Java**—a **compilation** step is necessary before the application can be used. Let's focus on **Java** for this explanation.
### Java Build Process:
When writing Java code, we do so in files with the `.java` extension. These files can be understood and edited using an **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment), which is a development environment for coding. However, to run a Java application, the `.java` files must be **compiled** into `.class` files. This compilation process transforms the Java source code into **bytecode**, a machine-readable language that can be executed by the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**.
### Automation of the Build Process in DevOps:
The **build process** in Java, and in other compiled languages, is crucial for creating an executable application. In the **DevOps methodology**, this process can be fully **automated** using tools like **Jenkins**, **Maven**, or **Gradle**, which ensure that every time new code is integrated, it is compiled, tested, and prepared for deployment without manual intervention. This automation helps streamline development workflows, ensuring faster delivery of high-quality software.
