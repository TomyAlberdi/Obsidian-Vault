**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** refers to managing infrastructure using templates that can be versioned, allowing automation of manual processes needed to achieve the desired outcome. Just as running the same application code produces consistent results, IaC ensures that running the same infrastructure code always results in the same infrastructure setup. This concept is vital for implementing **DevOps** methodologies, enabling faster and more secure environments for applications.
## Procedure
1. **Analyze** the infrastructure needed based on application requirements.
2. **Calculate** how many infrastructure replicas are needed.
3. **Write the template** for the infrastructure.
4. **Execute the template** using an IaC tool or provide it to another team to execute when required.
In IaC, configuration files are created to simplify infrastructure editing and distribution, ensuring consistent environments are created every time. **Version control** is also essential for IaC and should be applied to configuration files just like any other software source code.
Though well-documented, the process can still face obstacles such as time constraints or inconsistencies in documentation. IaC offers a solution by automating infrastructure tasks, leading to faster response times and more flexible software development environments.
## Benefits
- **Reduction of human error**:
  By following clear and ordered procedures, the risk of misconfigurations or accidental deletions is minimized. This builds confidence in the provided infrastructure.
- **Reproducibility and predictability**:
  When an application's context works, it can be reliably reproduced. This results in a more testable and stable infrastructure, with predictable outcomes every time.
- **Time efficiency and waste reduction**:
  The infrastructure can be executed in minutes without needing extra components. The automation process is always ready to be triggered as needed.
- **Version control**:
  Infrastructure is defined in files, making it versionable just like application source code. Using parameters, the infrastructure code can be generalized and customized with specific inputs during execution.
- **Cost reduction**:
  By automating processes, teams can focus on other tasks, improving productivity. This flexibility allows infrastructure teams to take on more responsibilities and reduces overhead.
- **Testing**:
  IaC enables infrastructure teams to test applications in any environment, including production, early in the development cycle.
- **Stable and scalable environments**:
  By avoiding manual configurations and dependencies, IaC ensures environments are stable and scalable, providing the final state required for applications.
- **Configuration standardization**:
  Standardizing infrastructure deployment helps avoid compatibility issues and ensures applications run at optimal performance.
- **Documentation**:
  IaC enhances documentation by versioning infrastructure changes, tracking them by user, and providing fast rollback options if deployment errors occurâ€”similar to managing source code.
- **Faster execution with security**:
  As infrastructure is improved, security must always be a priority. IaC helps standardize both infrastructure execution and security groups, providing minimal but necessary permissions to avoid manual security tasks.
