A **hybrid cloud** is an IT architecture that integrates and manages workloads across two or more environments. Depending on the definition, these environments could include:
- At least one private cloud and one public cloud.
- Two or more private clouds.
- Two or more public clouds.
- A virtual or non-OS environment connected to at least one public or private cloud.
## Key Functions
All hybrid clouds must be able to:
- Connect multiple computers over a network.
- Consolidate IT resources.
- Scale horizontally and deploy new resources quickly.
- Move workloads between environments.
- Integrate a single, unified management tool.
- Organize processes through automation.
## How it works
Public and private clouds within a hybrid cloud operate similarly to how they function independently:
- **Networks**: Local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), virtual private networks (VPNs), and application programming interfaces (APIs) connect multiple computers.
- **Resource Abstraction**: Virtualization, containers, or software-defined storage abstract resources into data lakes.
- **Management Software**: Assigns these resources to environments where applications can run, which are deployed as requested, using an authentication service.
Independent clouds become hybrid when connected in the simplest way possible. This interconnectivity allows hybrid clouds to operate and is foundational for **edge computing**. It also facilitates workload movement, unified management, and process organization. The quality of connections directly affects the hybrid cloud's performance.
## Modern Architecture
Modern hybrid clouds no longer rely on a vast network of APIs to move workloads between clouds. Instead, modern IT teams:
- **Standardize the OS** across all IT environments.
- **Develop and deploy** applications as small, independent, and decoupled services (often microservices).
- **Manage everything with a unified Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)**.
By using the same operating system, hardware dependencies are abstracted. The orchestration platform manages application dependencies, creating a uniform and interconnected computing environment where applications can be moved between environments without the need for complex API mappings that could fail with updates or provider changes.
This interconnectivity enables development and operations teams to collaborate using a **DevOps** model, where teams work together in integrated environments using a microservices architecture compatible with containers.
## Security
A properly designed, integrated, and managed hybrid cloud can be as secure as on-premises IT infrastructure. While there are unique security challenges in hybrid clouds (such as data migration, increased complexity, and a larger attack surface), having multiple interconnected environments can offer strong defense against security risks. This flexibility allows companies to choose where to store sensitive data based on requirements, while security teams can adopt uniform, redundant cloud storage systems that enhance disaster recovery efforts.
