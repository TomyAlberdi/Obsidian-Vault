#Theory 
Dynamic testing requires the execution of the software, component, or system. It complements [[Static Testing|static]] [[testing]] by detecting different types of defects. Various techniques such as black-box, white-box, or experience-based testing are used to generate test cases.
In dynamic testing, the software is executed using a set of input values, and the results are analyzed and compared to the expected outcome.
#### Common Defects Found with Dynamic Testing:
- **Functionality failures**.
- **Module interaction failures**.
- **Performance and security failures**.
## Comparison with Static Testing

| Static Testing                                                     | Dynamic Testing                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Based on manual evaluation through reviews and static analysis.    | Requires execution of the software, component, or system.   |
| Detects defects in work products.                                  | Detects defects and failures when the software is executed. |
| Focuses on improving the consistency and quality of work products. | Focuses on externally visible behaviors.                    |
| Lower cost to fix defects.                                         | Higher cost to fix defects.                                 |
