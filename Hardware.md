#Theory 
Hardware encompasses the electronic components themselves, such as video cards, memory, keyboards, and all tangible components we use to interact with our computer.
## Parts of a Computer's Hardware
### Internal Components
#### Motherboard:
The main board of any computer, to which all other devices connect, either directly (like interconnected electrical circuits) or indirectly (through USB ports or other types of connectors).
#### Processor:
Also called the Central Processing Unit or [[CPU]], it is the "brain" of the computer; its function is to interpret and execute instructions through basic operations: arithmetic and logic. It "directs" the operations performed by the computer. It is located on the motherboard and has a heat sink on it.
#### RAM and ROM:
##### RAM:
RAM or Random Access [[Memory]] is the component that temporarily stores information. Its contents are erased every time it loses electrical conductivity or, in other words, every time the computer is turned off.
##### ROM:
ROM or Read Only [[Memory]], on the other hand, stores information permanently. It saves everything related to the initial configuration for the machine's startup and basic operation.
#### Video and Sound Cards:
These are internal components connected to the motherboard.
##### Video Card:
Also known as a graphics card, it is responsible for displaying images on the monitor. It refers to the set formed by the GPU (Graphic Processing Unit), memory modules, heat sink, video outputs, etc.
##### Sound Card:
The sound card allows the computer to play sounds through headphones or speakers. It also allows receiving sounds through microphones.
#### Secondary Storage Devices:
They store data permanently. This is information that the computer does not need immediately for its operation. They can store all types of files, such as documents, images, videos, audios, etc. The internal secondary storage device is the hard drive.
#### Power Supply:
Converts the energy from the power outlet into the type of energy the computer needs. It sends this energy through cables to the motherboard and other components.
### External Components or Peripherals:
These are all devices that connect to the CPU to add functions or operations to the computer but are not essential parts of it. There are three types.
#### Input Devices:
These are devices that only serve to input data, that is, to capture new information or communicate the user with the computer. (Keyboard, microphone, mouse, webcam).
#### Output Devices:
These are peripherals that allow extracting information from the computer. It is the only way the computer can emit information and communicate with the user. (Monitor, speakers, printer, projector).
#### Mixed Devices:
These are devices that allow both input and output of information from the computer. They perform the tasks of both input and output devices simultaneously. (Touchscreen, modem, CD or DVD writers).
