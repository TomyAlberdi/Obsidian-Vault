#Theory 
A framework is a set of tools that facilitate [[software]] development. To achieve this, they include implements such as the following:
- APIs
- [[Libraries]]
- Debugging tools
- Editing
- Prototyping
- Support programs
Frameworks are not necessarily tied to a specific [[Programming Language|language]], although this is often the case. For example, in Ruby on Rails, "Ruby" is the programming language and "Rails" is the framework. However, there are no impediments to defining the same framework for different languages. It is also possible for the framework to define a structure for a complete application or to focus on just one aspect of it.
Examples:
- Vue.js
- Angular
- ExpressJS
- Laravel
- Flask
