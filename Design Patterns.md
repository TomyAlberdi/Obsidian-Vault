#Theory 
Design patterns are guidelines for addressing potential issues in application development. They provide quick solutions to simple and recurring problems, allowing for faster design development. They are divided into three categories:
#### Creation Patterns:
These aim to abstract the process of how [[Object-Oriented Programming|objects]] are created in an application. They provide [[interfaces]] for creating and copying objects, and for producing families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. Additionally, they allow for different representations using the same code.
#### Structural Patterns:
These deal with the composition of classes and objects. They enable collaboration between objects with incompatible interfaces by adding new behaviors. This way, we can divide a class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies (abstraction and implementation), which can be developed independently of each other. They also allow objects to be composed into a tree structure and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
#### Behavioral Patterns:
These focus on the relationships between objects and classes, and the distribution of responsibilities within an application. Some of these patterns are based on using inheritance to distribute behavior among classes, while others use composition.

A design pattern is not a pre-fabricated code or a final version; it is a model for solving a specific problem. Design patterns define the relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the details of the involved entities. Conceptually, a design pattern should define: a name, the problem, the solution, when to apply the solution, and the consequences of applying it.
