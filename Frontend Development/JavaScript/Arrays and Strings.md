## Arrays
Arrays allow us to create an ordered collection of data.
### Structure:
We use square brackets to indicate the start and end of an array, and commas to separate its elements. Within an array, we can store as many elements as we want, regardless of their data type. This means we can have strings, numbers, booleans, and other data types all in the same array.
```js
let myArray = ['Star Wars', true, 23];
```
### Indexes:
Each piece of data in an array occupies a numbered position known as an **index**. The first position of an array is always index 0. To access a specific element in an array, we name the array and write the index inside square brackets.
```js
let favoriteMovies = ['Star Wars', 'Kill Bill', 'Alien'];
favoriteMovies[2]; // Accesses the movie "Alien", which has index 2
```
### Length:
Another useful property of arrays is their length, or the number of elements they contain. We can find out the number of elements using the `length` property. To access the length of an array, name the array, followed by a dot and the word `length`.
```js
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
myArray.length; // Returns 8
```
