It is composed of all those devices capable of permanently storing data. These devices can be internal, like the hard drive, or removable, like floppy disks and DVDs.
#### Characteristics:
- Information can be stored permanently.
- The processor cannot directly access the data. They must first be copied to the main memory.
- They are never volatile.
- Can store a large amount of data and information. Their capacity reaches up to terabytes.
- Secondary memory can only be accessed through input and output buses.
- Lower speed.
- Lower cost.
### Types of Secondary Memory:
- **Magnetic:** Stores data according to a magnetic pattern on a rotating disk covered by a magnetic membrane. They are the cheapest to build but the slowest. Examples: Magnetic tape, Diskette, Hard Drives.
- **Optical:** Bits are encoded as points of light and points without light, increasing the reading speed although limited by their storage capacity. Examples: CD, DVD, Blu-Ray.
- **Solid-State:** Use transistors that trap or eliminate electrical charges within their structure. They are the fastest but the most expensive to manufacture. Examples: Flash, Pendrive, SSD.
