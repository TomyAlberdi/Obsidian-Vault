## Bugs
A bug, also known as an error, is a mistake in a program or [[Operating System]] that triggers an undesired result. In software development, there are many types of bugs, but in general, several general types can be established based on their behavior.
- **Heisenbug:** Based on Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, these are bugs that alter or disappear their behavior when trying to debug them.
- **Bohrbug:** Named after the Bohr atomic model, this is a classification of an unusual software error that always produces a failure when restarting the operation that caused the failure.
- **Mandelbug:** Named after the mathematician Mandelbrot, a mandelbug is a failure with causes so complex that its behavior is completely chaotic.
- **Schroedinbugs:** These are errors that do not appear until someone reads the code and discovers that, under certain circumstances, the program could fail. From that moment on, the schroedinbug begins to appear repeatedly.
## Vulnerabilities
A vulnerability is a weakness or failure of a [[Computer]] system that can jeopardize the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of [[Information]]. Evaluating or detecting vulnerabilities allows recognizing, classifying, and characterizing security holes.
#### Steps to detect a vulnerability:
While there is no single method to detect vulnerabilities, it is possible to compile a series of items to consider to keep our information secure.
- Evaluate how the company's network and infrastructure are constituted.
- Delimit who can and should access confidential information.
- Test that the backups made work.
- Identify the most sensitive and essential parts of the system.
- Conduct audits of the state of computer security.
